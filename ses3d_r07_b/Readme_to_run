Preparation:
1) Earth velocity model in MODELS/MODELS_3D
2) source.txt: Simulation parameters (number of steps) and time interval and preliminary source location (lat, lon, dep)
3) stations.txt: Station location to simulate reciprocial Green's functions


Step 1) Edit INPUT/setup file for the study region and compile MODELS/SOURCE and SOURCE
Step 2) Run mesher in MODELS/MAIN
Step 3) Prepare INPUT/source_grid.txt for the possible source grid points
Step 4) Prepare source.txt and stations.txt files
